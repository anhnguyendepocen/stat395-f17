## Statistical Learning

Welcome to *Statistical Learning*. This semester you will learn how to build,
evaluate, and understand data-driven predictive models. This is really a
survey course and we will be giving just a brief introduction to a large
of number of topics. Two focuses, however, will be on working with text
and image datasets. These both fit my own research interests and are some
of the best illustrations of the potential and challenges of predictive
modelling.

All of the material for this course, including the notes here, are available
on our class website:

- [https://statsmaths.github.io/stat395/](https://statsmaths.github.io/stat395/)

The website has a detailed syllabus, today I will just cover some of the
most important aspects of it. Once we have covered the syllabus, I'll jump
right into some basic principles of data-driven predictive models. We'll
finish by explaining how to set up R and GitHub for the next class.

### Syllabus

*As mentioned, this is just a summary of the larger document located on the
course website.*

This course will be almost entirely code-centric. We will be using Python
throughout the semester. All of my notes (including this document) will be
given as jupyter notebooks. These are self-contained files that include
code, output, text, and graphics. All of your assignments will also be
handed in as jupyter notebooks. No prior experience with Python will be
assumed. The course is designed to require no formal prior programming
experience, but you should have some familiarity with a scripting language
such as R, Matlab, or Mathematica.

### labs

Every course through Thanksgiving will have an associated file named
`lab##.R`, with the class number replaced by the `##` symbol. Prior
to the start of the next class you must complete the questions contained
within the lab notebook. Assignments will be submitted through GitHub;
this process is explained more during our next class.

### final project

You will also complete a course project. The last two weeks of the semester
will consist of presentations of these projects.

### grades

Final grades will be determined by the following weighting scheme:

- labs (60%)
- final project (40%)

The actual syllabus file has more details concerning the specifics of
how to convert between numeric and letter grades.

### because someone will ask

There is no required textbook and there are no exams, final or otherwise.

## Introduction to Learning

Statistical learning, synonymous with machine learning, is the process
of extracting knowledge from data automatically, usually with the goal
of making predictions on new, unseen data. A classical example is a spam
filter, for which the user keeps labelling incoming mails as either spam or
not spam. A machine learning algorithm then "learns" a predictive
model from data that distinguishes spam from normal emails,
a model which can predict for new emails whether they are spam or not.

The data is presented to the algorithm usually as a two-dimensional
array (or matrix) of numbers. Each data point (also known as a *sample*
or *training instance*) that we want to either learn from or make a
decision on is represented as a list of numbers, a so-called
feature vector, and its containing features represent the properties
of this point.

## Example Tasks

**TODO: Add examples for other class notes**

## Set-up for next time

For next time, you are going to get GitHub, R and RStudio set-up.
For GitHub, if you do not already have an account, go to the main
webpage and create a free account. Try to pick a professional name
as you may find that you want to make this public at some point:

- https://github.com/

Once you have created your account, add some basic information
to your profile. At a minimum, include a photo and your preferred
name.

We will be using the R programming language for this course. Please follow
the instructions on the following website to download and install Python on
your machine.

- Windows: [https://cloud.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/](https://cloud.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/)
- Mac: [https://cloud.r-project.org/bin/macosx/R-3.4.1.pkg](https://cloud.r-project.org/bin/macosx/R-3.4.1.pkg)

Next, download RStudio. This is a nice GUI (I'm using it right now) that
improves the user experience of using R. Download it here:

- Windows: [https://download1.rstudio.org/RStudio-1.0.153.exe](https://download1.rstudio.org/RStudio-1.0.153.exe)
- Mac: [https://download1.rstudio.org/RStudio-1.0.153.dmg](https://download1.rstudio.org/RStudio-1.0.153.dmg)

Once you have those set-up, download the `setup.R` script:

- [setup.R](setup.R)

Open RStudio and run this file line by line. Note that this is
different than an RMarkdown file; all lines are considered code
unless they start with a `#` sign.

Finally, download the file `lab01.Rmd`:

- [lab01.Rmd](lab01.Rmd)

Try to run the file and get your results. Next class I will
show how to upload your results to GitHub.

## For next class

To recap, you have to do five things before our next class:

1. create a GitHub account; add a photo and preferred name
2. download and install R
3. download and install RStudio
4. download `setup.R` and run the file to install packages
5. download `lab01.Rmd` and re-run today's analysis

**If you run into any problems with this set-up, ideally please stop
by my office sometime tomorrow. I will make an effort to be around
most of the day. Otherwise, send me an e-mail or we can debug after
class on Thursday. You will NEED this to work for the assignment over
the weekend.**

## Questions

As a last task, please write the following on the index cards provided:

1. name (and prefered, if not obvious)
2. prior programming experience
3. have you taken linear algebra?
4. what is your interest in statistical learning?
5. types of applications you are particularly interested in

In case you're curious, here are my answers:

1. Taylor Arnold (Taylor or Dr. Arnold; please don't mix them up though!)
2. expert: R; advanced: C, C++, Python; familiar with: Java (yuck), javascript
3. technically I skipped linear algebra, but I do know it very well :)
4. predicting stuff is super fun!
5. text and image analysis with applications to linguistics and media studies
