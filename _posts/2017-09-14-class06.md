## Matrices

### Linear Maps

Consider all functions from an n-dimensional space into an
m-dimensional space,

$$ f: \mathbb{R}^n \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^m, $$

That preserves addition,

$$ f(u + v) = f(u) + f(v) $$

And multiplication by a fixed scalar value,

$$ f(\alpha \cdot u) = \alpha \cdot f(u), \quad \alpha \in \mathbb{R}. $$

Such functions are known as **linear maps** (the definition can be abstracted
to infinite dimensional spaces and over other fields, but we will only need
the finite real-valued case in this course).

There is an important representation theorem stating that every such mapping
can be described by an n-by-m array of real numbers. This array is commonly
called a **matrix**. How exactly do we calculate the function f given its
matrix representation A? It is easier to explain with fixed values for n
and m. Let's consider the following matrix:

$$ A = \left( \begin{array}{ccc} a_{1, 1} & a_{1, 2} & a_{1, 3} \\
                                 a_{2, 1} & a_{2, 2} & a_{2, 3} \end{array} \right) $$

So, in this case we have n = 3 and m = 2. Therefore this is a mapping that
takes a triple of numbers and returns a pair of numbers. Let's define
the input as a vector u:

$$ u = \left( \begin{array}{c} u_{1} \\
                               u_{2} \\
                               u_{3} \end{array} \right) $$


And the output as a vector v:

$$ v = \left( \begin{array}{c} v_{1} \\
                               v_{2} \end{array} \right) $$

The linear map is then defined as:

$$ \begin{align} v_1 &= a_{1,1} \cdot u_{1} + a_{1,2} \cdot u_{2} + a_{1,3} \cdot u_{3} \\
                 v_2 &= a_{2,1} \cdot u_{1} + a_{2,2} \cdot u_{2} + a_{3,3} \cdot u_{3}
                 \end{align} $$

So, each component of v is a linear combination of all components of u. We can
write this compactly using summation notation:

$$ v_i = \sum_{j = 1}^m a_{i, j} \cdot u_j $$

Conveniently, this last equation holds for any arbitrary choice of n and m.
Finally, we represent this symbolically by

$$ Au = v. $$

### Function composition

Consider two linear maps:

$$ \begin{align} f: \mathbb{R}^n \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^m \\
                 g: \mathbb{R}^m \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^p \end{align} $$


If we apply f to an vector in n-dimensional space we get an
m-dimensional vector. We could then take the output of this
map and apply g to it in order to get a p-dimensional vector.
This is known a function composition. We can represent the
action of first applying f and then applying g as a new function
h:

$$ h = g(f(u)), \quad h: \mathbb{R}^n \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^p $$

It is a fairly intuitive and easy to prove result that if f and
g are linear maps, so is h. Let f be represented by the matrix A,
g by the matrix B, and h by the matrix C. A natural question is
what relationship exists between A, B, and C?

It turns out that the result is just another sum:

$$ C_{i, j} = \sum_{k = 1}^{m} A_{i, k} \cdot B_{k, j} $$

This is known as a **matrix product** and is written as:

$$ C = A \cdot B = AB $$

If the concept of matrix multiplication is new to you, an animated
visualization of multiplying two matrices can be useful. Of course,
for this semester understanding the abstract meaning behind matrix
multiplication (function composition) is much more important than
grasping the mechanics of computing the new matrix:

Notice that if we represent vectors as one-column matrices, the
definition of matrix multiplication is equivalent to our definition
of applying a matrix to a vector:

$$ Au = v. $$

## Matrices in R

### Basics

There is extensive functionality for working with matrices in
R. Let's make a random 5-by-5 matrix and a 5-by-matrix, the
latter we can think of as a vector.


{% highlight r %}
A <- matrix(sample(1:99, 25), 5, 5)
A
{% endhighlight %}



{% highlight text %}
##      [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5]
## [1,]    9   44   45   97   89
## [2,]   80   98   39   25   82
## [3,]    4   78   67   31   29
## [4,]   26   28   83   41   48
## [5,]   99   22   27   85   87
{% endhighlight %}



{% highlight r %}
b <- matrix(sample(1:99, 5))
b
{% endhighlight %}



{% highlight text %}
##      [,1]
## [1,]    2
## [2,]   37
## [3,]   33
## [4,]   92
## [5,]   91
{% endhighlight %}

Element-wise arithmetic is assumed by default:


{% highlight r %}
A + A
{% endhighlight %}



{% highlight text %}
##      [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5]
## [1,]   18   88   90  194  178
## [2,]  160  196   78   50  164
## [3,]    8  156  134   62   58
## [4,]   52   56  166   82   96
## [5,]  198   44   54  170  174
{% endhighlight %}

To calculate a matrix produce, R requires us to use the
symbol `%*%`. If a matrix is square, there is nothing
stopping us from composing a matrix with itself:


{% highlight r %}
A %*% A
{% endhighlight %}



{% highlight text %}
##       [,1]  [,2]  [,3]  [,4]  [,5]
## [1,] 15114 12892 15590 14910 18113
## [2,] 17484 18670 14324 19414 24621
## [3,] 10221 14552 11067  8151 12706
## [4,]  8624 12566 12522 11556 13161
## [5,] 13582 12912 16526 21870 23047
{% endhighlight %}

Similarly, we can multiply the matrix by the column vector
to compute the action of the matrix A as a linear map:


{% highlight r %}
A %*% b
{% endhighlight %}



{% highlight text %}
##       [,1]
## [1,] 20154
## [2,] 14835
## [3,] 10596
## [4,] 11967
## [5,] 17640
{% endhighlight %}

The transpose of a matrix, denoted by using t as a superscript,
can be computed with the t function:


{% highlight r %}
t(A)
{% endhighlight %}



{% highlight text %}
##      [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5]
## [1,]    9   80    4   26   99
## [2,]   44   98   78   28   22
## [3,]   45   39   67   83   27
## [4,]   97   25   31   41   85
## [5,]   89   82   29   48   87
{% endhighlight %}

This is often useful in matrix computations. Similarly, we
can computing the inverse of a matrix with the function
`solve`:


{% highlight r %}
solve(A)
{% endhighlight %}



{% highlight text %}
##              [,1]         [,2]          [,3]         [,4]         [,5]
## [1,] -0.011934114 -0.001718682  0.0058710371 -0.001612582  0.012761056
## [2,] -0.001006377  0.001959783  0.0152616434 -0.013130666  0.001339652
## [3,] -0.004754789 -0.002529721  0.0006563454  0.015841327 -0.001710395
## [4,]  0.000302177 -0.015603472  0.0201384645 -0.014123053  0.015476805
## [5,]  0.015015078  0.017490022 -0.0304193061  0.014037516 -0.017955915
{% endhighlight %}

A matrix inverse, by definition, describes the inverse of the underlying
linear map (its also relatively simple to show that linear maps have
linear inverses, when they exist). Note that matrix inversion is a
computationally unstable procedure and should be avoided when possible.

### Subsetting matrices

It will often be useful to take a subset of the rows and
columns in a matrix. Here we take rows 2 and 3 and columns
1 and 2:


{% highlight r %}
A[2:3, 1:2]
{% endhighlight %}



{% highlight text %}
##      [,1] [,2]
## [1,]   80   98
## [2,]    4   78
{% endhighlight %}

Here we take columns 1 and 2; by leaving the rows
component empty every row is returned:


{% highlight r %}
A[,1:2]
{% endhighlight %}



{% highlight text %}
##      [,1] [,2]
## [1,]    9   44
## [2,]   80   98
## [3,]    4   78
## [4,]   26   28
## [5,]   99   22
{% endhighlight %}

There is a strange convention in R that, by default, if we
select a sub-matrix with only one row or one column, the
result will be converted from a rectangular matrix to a
non-dimensional vector. Notice that the output below is
not given as a matrix with one column:


{% highlight r %}
A[,1]
{% endhighlight %}



{% highlight text %}
## [1]  9 80  4 26 99
{% endhighlight %}

Usually this is not a problem, but if we want to be safe
we can add the option `drop = FALSE` to the subset command.
Notice the difference in the output here compared to the
output above:


{% highlight r %}
A[,1,drop = FALSE]
{% endhighlight %}



{% highlight text %}
##      [,1]
## [1,]    9
## [2,]   80
## [3,]    4
## [4,]   26
## [5,]   99
{% endhighlight %}

Finally, we can also subset by giving a logical statement
in either the rows or columns spot. Here we select only those
rows where the numbers 1 through 5 are greater than 3:


{% highlight r %}
A[1:5 > 3,]
{% endhighlight %}



{% highlight text %}
##      [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5]
## [1,]   26   28   83   41   48
## [2,]   99   22   27   85   87
{% endhighlight %}

As expected, the output is a matrix with just two rows.

## Multivariate Linear Models

### Matrix Formulation

We have been working with multivariate linear models over the
past few classes, though I have only ever written the formal
equation in the case where there are two explanatory variables.
In general, multivariate regression represents the following
model:

$$y_i = x_{1,i} \beta_1 + x_{2,i} \beta_2 + \cdots + x_{1,p} \beta_p + \epsilon_i$$

For simplicity, we won't include an explicit intercept term in
the model. If we want one, we will just make the first variable $x_{1,i}$
equal to one for every value of i.

The statistical estimation problem is to estimate the p
components of the multivariate vector beta.

Using our matrix notation, we can write the linear model
simultaneously for all observations:

$$ \left(\begin{array}{c}y_1\\ y_2\\ \vdots\\ y_n\end{array}\right) =
  \left(\begin{array}{cccc}x_{1,1}&x_{2,1}&\cdots&x_{p,1}\\
                           x_{1,2}&\ddots&&x_{p,2}\\
                           \vdots&&\ddots&\vdots\\
                           x_{1,n}&x_{2,n}&\cdots&x_{p,n}\\\end{array}\right)
  \left(\begin{array}{c}\beta_1\\ \beta_2\\ \vdots\\ \beta_p\end{array}\right) +
  \left(\begin{array}{c}\epsilon_1\\ \epsilon_2\\ \vdots\\ \epsilon_n\end{array}\right) $$


Which can be compactly written as:

$$ y = X \beta + \epsilon $$

The matrix X is known as the **design matrix** or **model matrix**.
For reference, note the following equation yields these dimensions:

$$ y \in \mathbb{R}^n $$
$$ X \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times p} $$
$$ \beta \in \mathbb{R}^p $$
$$ \epsilon \in \mathbb{R}^n $$

### Solving Linear Models

Calculating the OLS solution for multivariate linear regression involves,
in matrix notation, finding the beta vector that minimizes the sum of
squared residuals. We can write, in matrix notation, the residuals as
the following:

$$ r(\beta) = y - X \beta $$

And the sum of squared residuals can be derived as:

$$ \begin{align} \text{sum of squared residuals} &= r(\beta)^t r(\beta) \\
    &= \sum_{i = 1}^n r(\beta)_i \cdot r(\beta)_i
    \end{align} $$

This is a length n vector (or, equivalently, an n-by-1 matrix). The
optimization task can then be written compactly as:

$$ \begin{align} \widehat{\beta} &= \arg\min_b \left\{ r(b)^t r(b)  \right\} \\
      &= \arg\min_b \left\{ (y - X b)^t (y - X b)  \right\}
    \end{align} $$

To find the minimizer, we calculate the gradient and set it equal to
zero. This is not hard if you have learned how to work with gradients
(and also, remember what you learned):

$$ \begin{align} \nabla_b \left(r(b)^t r(b)\right)
   &= \nabla_b \left((y - X b)^t (y - X b)\right) \\
   &= \nabla_b \left(y^t y + b^t X^t X b - 2 b^t X^t y\right) \\
   &= 2 X^t X b - 2 X^t y.
  \end{align} $$

Setting this equal to zero, we derive what are known as the normal
equations (yes, this is plural; why?!):

$$ (X^t X) \cdot \widehat{\beta} = X^t y. $$

If the inverse exists, this gives an analytic formula for solving
the linear system of equations:

$$ \widehat{\beta} = (X^t X)^{-1} \cdot X^t y. $$

I could be even more formal about this and show that the Hessian matrix
is positive semi-definite everywhere and therefore we have found a global
minimum. Under the assumption that many of your are already overwhelmed
at this point, I'll skip this for today.

## Linear Models with Matrices in R

Let's now try to apply these theoretical ideas to an actual dataset.
I'll load in the flights data from my website:


{% highlight r %}
flights <- read_csv("~/files/ml_data/flights_15min.csv")
{% endhighlight %}

Note that the flights data, like every other dataset we have used,
is not a matrix. It is something that R calls a **data frame**:


{% highlight r %}
class(flights)
{% endhighlight %}



{% highlight text %}
## [1] "tbl_df"     "tbl"        "data.frame"
{% endhighlight %}

While both matrices and data frames have data organized in rows and
columns, matrices force all of the data to be numeric (its actually
more complicated than this in R, but just go along with it for now).
A data frame on the other hand can have different variable types in
each column.

An easy way to construct a matrix in R, is to use the `select` function
to grab only numeric columns and the function `as.matrix` to convert
the output into a matrix object. We will throughout the course use the
notation that the variable y is a vector holding the response of
interest and X is a matrix containing the variables we want to use in
a model.


{% highlight r %}
y <- flights$delayed

X <- as.matrix(select(flights, arr_hour, dep_hour))
X[1:10,]
{% endhighlight %}



{% highlight text %}
##       arr_hour dep_hour
##  [1,]       22       21
##  [2,]       13       11
##  [3,]       22       21
##  [4,]       22       20
##  [5,]       14       12
##  [6,]       16        8
##  [7,]       21       15
##  [8,]       19       17
##  [9,]       12        9
## [10,]       12       11
{% endhighlight %}

We can then create specific training and validation sets
using the logical subset method from above:


{% highlight r %}
X_train <- X[flights$train_id == "train", ]
X_valid <- X[flights$train_id == "valid", ]
y_train <- y[flights$train_id == "train"]
y_valid <- y[flights$train_id == "valid"]
{% endhighlight %}

From here, we can compute the regression vector beta:


{% highlight r %}
beta <- solve(t(X_train) %*% X_train) %*% t(X_train) %*% y_train
beta
{% endhighlight %}



{% highlight text %}
##               [,1]
## arr_hour 0.0522682
## dep_hour 0.0531534
{% endhighlight %}

So this generally looks good, but we left out the intercept. Recall
that our matrix formulation required us to add an explicit column of
1's if we wanted an intercept. Let's do this directly in the matrix
X using the `cbind` function, and repeat:


{% highlight r %}
X <- as.matrix(select(flights, arr_hour, dep_hour))
X <- cbind(1, X)
X_train <- X[flights$train_id == "train", ]
X_valid <- X[flights$train_id == "valid", ]

beta <- solve(t(X_train) %*% X_train) %*% t(X_train) %*% y_train
beta
{% endhighlight %}



{% highlight text %}
##                [,1]
##          0.20905417
## arr_hour 0.04406644
## dep_hour 0.04824098
{% endhighlight %}

Perfect, now we have a regression vector. To do prediction,
we just calculate X times beta:


{% highlight r %}
y_valid_pred <- X_valid %*% beta
sqrt(mean( (y_valid - y_valid_pred)^2))
{% endhighlight %}



{% highlight text %}
## [1] 2.415901
{% endhighlight %}

Let's verify that this gives the same output as the `lm` function:


{% highlight r %}
model <- lm(delayed ~ arr_hour +  dep_hour, data = flights,
            subset = train_id == "train")
model
{% endhighlight %}



{% highlight text %}
## 
## Call:
## lm(formula = delayed ~ arr_hour + dep_hour, data = flights, subset = train_id == 
##     "train")
## 
## Coefficients:
## (Intercept)     arr_hour     dep_hour  
##     0.20905      0.04407      0.04824
{% endhighlight %}

And, as hoped, it does!

## Using lm.fit

We have seen how to use the `lm` function to quickly fit
linear regression directly from data frames. Now, we also
know how to do this directly with matrix operations. There
is an intermediate function that solves the linear regression
problem directly from our matrices called `lm.fit`. In
fact, the `lm` function internally calls this function.
As inputs, it takes just the X matrix and response y. There
is a lot of diagnostic output, but we will take just the
`coef` component, corresponding to the coefficients matrix:


{% highlight r %}
lm.fit(X_train, y_train)$coef
{% endhighlight %}



{% highlight text %}
##              arr_hour   dep_hour 
## 0.20905417 0.04406644 0.04824098
{% endhighlight %}

This, once again, aligns with the output from the other
two methods.
