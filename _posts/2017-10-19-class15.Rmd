```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(eval = TRUE)
knitr::opts_chunk$set(fig.path = "../assets/2017-10-19-class15/")
knitr::opts_chunk$set(fig.height = 5)
knitr::opts_chunk$set(fig.width = 8.5)
knitr::opts_chunk$set(out.width = "100%")
knitr::opts_chunk$set(dpi = 300)
```

There are no notes for today. Instead, our project is to perform
some much needed data collection. It is also beautiful outside so
it seems best to enjoy it while it lasts!
