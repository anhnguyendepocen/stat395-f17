## Backpropagation

$$ \begin{align} \widehat{Y} &= \sigma(X \cdot A) \cdot B \\
                 \widehat{Y} &= Z \cdot B \end{align} \\
                 $$

It will be easier to index of $A$ as a vector, with elements $a_i$ rather than
having to keep track of the 2-dimensional nature of the matrix.

$$ \frac{\partial f}{\partial a_{i}} =
    \sum_k \frac{\partial z_{k}}{\partial a_{i}} \cdot \frac{\partial f}{\partial z_{k}} $$


$$ \frac{\partial f}{\partial z_{k}} =
    \sum_j \frac{\partial \widehat{y}_{j}}{\partial z_{k}} \cdot \frac{\partial f}{\partial \widehat{y}_{j}} $$
