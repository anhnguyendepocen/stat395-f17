  <h3>Final Project</h3>
  <p>
    A major part (34%) of your grade for this course comes from
    the course's final project. The basic idea is that you will
    write up a report similar to the labs but with significantly
    more exposition about what you are doing and what the results
    show. For a good benchmark, think of what my lecture notes look
    like. Not too formal, but all of the ideas written out in words.
    In the last two weeks of the semester, we will have presentations
    based on these write-ups.
  </p>
  <p>
    The overarching goal of the assignment is for you to apply what
    we have learned this semester to a dataset that has not been nicely
    cleaned for analysis. The skills we have covered are very applicable
    and I want to make sure you all feel comfortable applying them to
    real datasets outside of the ridge format I gave you in the course.
  </p>
  <p>
    I am open to alternative ideas, but I see there being four main
    approaches to the final project.
    <ul>
        <li><b>kaggle:</b> choose a Kaggle machine learning competition
        and write up your attempts to build a predictive model. Generally,
        make sure that the dataset is sufficiently difficult by choosing
        something that includes multiple input files or works with text,
        image, or other non-tabular datasources.</li>
        <li><b>data collection:</b> create a new dataset yourself,
        load it into R, and apply statistical learning techniques to the
        data. This could in theory be from any source, but to be interesting
        it will probably be either collecting another photo dataset or
        curating a dataset of texts</li>
        <li><b>new method:</b> find a new method and/or R package that we
        have not covered in class and apply this to your dataset. Ideas
        include working with time series, network data, or using Bayesian
        models. Your write-up should include background on the method
        similar to what my lecture notes cover.</li>
    </ul>
    All of them require applying predictive
    modelling to a new dataset, but differ in what skills are emphasises.
  </p>
  <p>More details to come, but start thinking about which of these interest
  you. Feel free to email or stop by my office if you would like to talk
  about options.</p>
