  <h3>Final Project</h3>
  <p>
    A major part (34%) of your grade for this course comes from
    the course's final project. The basic idea is that you will
    write up a report similar to the labs but with significantly
    more exposition about what you are doing and what the results
    show. For a good benchmark, think of what my lecture notes look
    like. Not too formal, but all of the ideas written out in words.
    In the last two weeks of the semester, we will have presentations
    based on these write-ups.
  </p>
  <p>
    The overarching goal of the assignment is for you to apply what
    we have learned this semester to a dataset that has not been nicely
    cleaned for analysis. The skills we have covered are very applicable
    and I want to make sure you all feel comfortable applying them to
    real datasets outside of the ridge format I gave you in the course.
  </p>
  <p>
    I am open to alternative ideas, but I see there being four main
    approaches to the final project.
    <ul>
        <li><b>kaggle:</b> choose a Kaggle machine learning competition
        and write up your attempts to build a predictive model. Generally,
        make sure that the dataset is sufficiently difficult by choosing
        something that includes multiple input files or works with text,
        image, or other non-tabular datasources.</li>
        <li><b>data collection:</b> create a new dataset yourself,
        load it into R, and apply statistical learning techniques to the
        data. This could in theory be from any source, but to be interesting
        it will probably be either collecting another photo dataset or
        curating a dataset of texts</li>
        <li><b>new method:</b> find a new method and/or R package that we
        have not covered in class and apply this to your dataset. Ideas
        include working with time series, network data, or using Bayesian
        models. Your write-up should include background on the method
        similar to what my lecture notes cover.</li>
    </ul>
    All of them require applying predictive
    modelling to a new dataset, but differ in what skills are emphasises.
  </p>
  <p>
    Submission details:
      <ul>
        <li>You should upload your project on your GitHub page as a file
          named <b>final_project.Rmd</b> as well as the knit version
          <b>final_project.html</b>. You should also upload the dataset
          you are using, unless it can be downloaded from the web via
          a direct link (in which case, please provide the link). If
          this is not feasible, please let me know.</li>
        <li>I will copy our final project html file to the course website,
          so be aware that these will be generally accessible. The file
          should include your name at the top. If there are special
          circumstances where you would not like this to be publicly
          available, please also let me know ahead of time.</li>
        <li>You should submit your final project by noon on the day in
          which you present.</li>
      </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    Presentation schedule and details:
      <ul>
        <li>Presentations will take place in class during the final four
        class periods. This gives each student approximately 10 minutes
        each.</li>
        <li>On Thursday, 09 November, I will ask you all to write down
        your proposed topic and preferred presentation dates. If you will
        not be in class, please email me this information.</li>
        <li>By 10 November, I will release a schedule of who is presenting
        when. I will also let you know if your topic is inappropriate or needs
        some clarification by that point.</li>
        <li>If everyone want to go on the same days, I will find a fair way of
        devising the schedule.</li>
        <li>Note that I expect you all to be present during all presentations.
        I have a strict no-laptop / no-cellphone policy during presentations.</li>
        <li>If you behave, there may be snacks.</li>
        <li>There will be a final lab 24, but no further labs after that (it is
        a fun, easy lab to finish the semester with).</li>
        <li>You are done (other than attending the final classes) once you
        finish the final project</li>
      </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    I initial thought of creating a rubric for the final project, but I am not sure
    that this would be very helpful for you all. Just keep in mind that there should
    be much more expository text than the labs and you should practice your presentation
    once.
