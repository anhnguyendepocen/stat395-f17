<h1>Labs</h1>
Every course will have an associated lab file. By noon before the start of the next class, you must complete the questions contained within the lab notebook. Assignments will be submitted through GitHub; this process is explained more during our next class.

Each lab will generally consist of looking at a new dataset with some missing responses. You need to build, documenting all of your steps and justify why you are doing them, a predictive model and fill in the missing values.
