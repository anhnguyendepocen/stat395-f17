# Class 01: Introduction to Statistical Learning

- finished lecture in about 50 minutes
- try to clarify the labs daily vs. 3 times per semester thing
- youtube links are great

# Class 02: Sleepy Mammals and Sea Snails

- finished notes and demonstration in just over an hour
- remember to remind people that this is by far the most
amount of new functions / techniques they will see this
semester
- had to debug some minor issues; for example, need to
download 'curl' package for R not to complain when loading
readr

# Class 03: The Lady Tasting Tea

- total lecture took about 1h, though longer with some
questions at end about labs
- no real questions throughout about the material today
- mostly concerned with labs and results
- need to create a minimal template showing how this was
completed

# Class 04: Fuel Efficiency in the Big City

- lecture took about 1h5; lots of questions about validation
and how to use it... would not change anything per say but
these were great to have asked off-hand
- while giving the notes, I forgot about the part that
teaches how to use the `subset` option; had to go back and
re-do it; don't forget next time
