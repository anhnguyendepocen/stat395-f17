- finished lecture in about 50 minutes
- try to clarify the labs daily vs. 3 times per semester thing
- youtube links are great

amount of new functions / techniques they will see this
semester
- had to debug some minor issues; for example, need to
download 'curl' package for R not to complain when loading
readr

questions at end about labs

completed
